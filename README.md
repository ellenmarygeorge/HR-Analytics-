# HR Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing HR data to gain insights into employee attrition and performance. The project aims to leverage data science techniques to understand factors influencing employee turnover and to build predictive models for attrition prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), titled [HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists). It includes various features such as education level, experience, company size, and previous job roles, along with the target variable indicating whether an employee is likely to leave the current job or not.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase involves understanding the dataset's structure, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between different variables. Jupyter notebooks containing EDA code can be found in the `notebooks` directory.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for building predictive models. In this phase, we preprocess and transform the features to improve model performance. The `feature_engineering.py` script in the `src` directory contains functions for feature engineering tasks.

## Model Building

Several machine learning algorithms are explored to predict employee attrition, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting. The `model_building.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` directory demonstrates the model building process.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. The `evaluation.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` directory contains code for evaluating model performance on test data.

## Deployment

Once a satisfactory model is built and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-world use. Deployment strategies, such as deploying as a web service or integrating into existing HR systems, are explored in the `deployment` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have suggestions for improvements or encounter any issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
