# HR-Analytics-PowerBI Dashboard
This is a Power BI end to end project.
I created an HR analytics dashboard using Power BI, providing insightful visualizations on key HR metrics. This Power BI dashboard effectively visualizes critical HR data, enabling the organization to identify patterns and factors influencing employee attrition. My role included data extraction, transformation, and visualization to support strategic HR decisions.

# To analyze the HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, a data analyst could pose a variety of questions to uncover insights and make data-driven decisions. Here are some sample questions that address different aspects of the dashboard data:

1.  General Overview: 
   - What is the total employee count and how many employees have left the company?
   - What is the overall attrition rate?

2.  Demographic Analysis: 
   - What is the average age of employees at the company?
   - How does attrition vary by gender?
   - How does the attrition rate vary across different age groups?

3.  Tenure and Experience: 
   - What is the average number of years employees stay at the company?
   - How does attrition vary by the number of years employees have been with the company?

4.  Salary and Compensation: 
   - What is the average salary of employees?
   - How does attrition rate change across different salary ranges?

5.  Education and Job Roles: 
   - What is the attrition rate for employees with different educational backgrounds?
   - Which job roles have the highest and lowest attrition rates?

6.  Departmental Insights: 
   - How does attrition vary across different departments (e.g., Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales)?
   - Within each department, which job roles are most affected by attrition?

7.  Age and Attrition: 
   - What are the attrition rates for different age categories?
   - How does attrition vary for employees under 25 compared to those over 55?

8.  Gender-Specific Trends: 
   - What is the attrition count for males versus females?
   - Are there any notable trends in attrition rates between male and female employees in specific job roles or departments?

9.  Detailed Role Analysis: 
   - For a specific job role, such as Sales Executives, what is the breakdown of attrition by years at the company?
   - How does the attrition rate for Research Scientists compare to that of Sales Representatives?

10.  Salary and Job Roles: 
    - What is the distribution of attrition across different salary bands for job roles such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives?
    - How does the attrition rate vary for employees earning below 5k compared to those earning above 15k?

By asking these questions, a data analyst can effectively leverage the Power BI dashboard to identify patterns, uncover potential issues, and develop strategies to improve employee retention and overall HR performance.
